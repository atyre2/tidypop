Demonstrate the use of `tidypop` for a range of ecological models, showing how 
to include stochasticity, time dependence, and make plots.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(tidypop)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Exponential growth

`tidypop` uses discrete time, but 
[I think the distinction between exponential and geometric growth is meaningless](https://drewtyre.rbind.io/post/geometric-vs-exponential-growth-models-a-zombie-idea/).
The formula for the model is
$$
N_{t+1} = N_{t}e^{r_t}
$$
and in code:
```{r exponential1a}
exppop <- function(N0, r){
  N1 <- N0*exp(r)
  return(N1)
}
```

`tidypop::iterate()` needs a tibble or dataframe with one row for each timestep.
The name is arbitrary, but I call it parms. There must be one column for each
argument to `exppop()` other than `N0`. It can be useful for plotting to include
some kind of label for each timestep.

```{r exponential1b}
parms <- tibble(t = 1:20, r = rep(0.05, 20))
```

With those two pieces we can now use iterate to add a column with the projected 
population size called N. We also have to choose a starting population size.

```{r exponential1c}
results <- iterate(parms, 33, exppop)
head(results)
```

Making a plot is very straightforward with ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = results,
       mapping = aes(x = t, y = N)) +
  geom_point()
```

or with base R

```{r}
plot(results$t, results$N)
```


`tidyr::crossing()` is very useful here
