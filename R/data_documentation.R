#' Helmeted Honeyeater projection matrices
#'
#' 3 age structured projection matrices for Helmeted Honeyeaters in 1991-1994, and
#' the associated population vectors.
#'
#' This bird is critically endangered, restricted to 3 small populations
#' just east of Melbourne. Zoos Victoria contributes to conservation by captive
#' rearing individuals to supplement wild populations, as well as maintaining a
#' captive population "lifeboat" for the species.
